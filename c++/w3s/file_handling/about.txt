I am Victor Mokut.

I am a passionate computer scientist and software engineering looking to contribute immensely to the computer science through effective researching and discoveries that will impact the computer science landscape.

Innovations drives me, and I do not intend to merely sit around and watch every other person innovate while I consume, though, not so much.*
